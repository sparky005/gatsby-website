This post is my very first using Gatsby as a blogging platform. Gatsby is a framework based on React that "helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps." You can find out more on [their website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

The image was sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/jY_fTS7ZE98), which is a great place to get images that are free to use.

Perhaps in my next post I will talk about why I chose to create a new blog and migrate away from Pelican, which I forgot how to use basically every time I wanted to use it.
